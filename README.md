## Carousel

The purpose of this homework is to leverage views, view properties, and events to create a high fidelity prototype that is difficult to distinguish from a production app. We're going to use the techniques from this week to implement the Carousel app from the signed out state to the basic signed in state.

Time spent: `7 hours`

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. automatically trigger animations like bounce or scroll
2. more animation types or exercises with transform

## Notes

I found manipulating layers in Storyboard frustrating given hovering an element over a group (such as a Scroll View) automatically embeds the layer inside the parent. Using the CMD key to "unbind" the elements when dragging helped a lot.
